    Austin Richard Post (born July 4, 1995),[1] known professionally as Post Malone, is an American rapper, singer, and songwriter. Known for his introspective songwriting and variegated vocal styles, Malone has gained acclaim for blending genres and subgenres of pop, hip hop, R&B, and trap. His stage name was derived from inputting his birth name into a rap name generator.[3]

    Malone began his music career as an independent artist in 2013 and attained recognition with his 2015 debut single "White Iverson",[4] which peaked at number 14 on the US Billboard Hot 100. Malone soon signed a recording contract with Republic Records[5] and released his debut studio album, Stoney, in 2016, which contained the diamond hit single "Congratulations".[6] The album set the record for most weeks (77) on the US Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.[7] Malone's second album, Beerbongs & Bentleys (2018), debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 and set several streaming records.[7] It also contained the Hot 100 number-one singles "Rockstar" and "Psycho", and was nominated for Album of the Year at the 2018 Grammy Awards.
    
    His third number one, "Sunflower" (with Swae Lee), was the promotional and lead single to the soundtrack for the film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018), and was included on Malone's third album, Hollywood's Bleeding (2019), which became Malone's second number one. Its second single, "Circles", also reached number one and set the record for the most weeks (39) in the top ten on the Hot 100.[8]
    
    Among the best-selling music artists with over 80 million records sold,[9] Malone has won 10 Billboard Music Awards, three American Music Awards, one MTV Video Music Award, and has received six Grammy Award nominations.[10] He holds several Billboard chart records: he is the first solo artist to top the Rap Airplay and Adult Contemporary charts, while "Circles" set the record for longest climb to number one (41 weeks) on the Adult Contemporary chart by a solo artist.[11]
